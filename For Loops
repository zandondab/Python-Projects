#Modifying a for loop program so that it prints "Ouack" and "Quack" but leaves the other names the same. Solution:

i= 0     #declaring new variable i to store indices as program traverses the string
prefixes = 'JKLMNOPQ'  #creating variable to store string
suffix = 'ack'          #another variable that will be concartneted to the prefixes as the loop iterates
for letter in prefixes:     #loop to traverse the string
    if (letter[i] == 'O'):      #condition to single out letter of interest, O 
        print ('Ou' + suffix)
    elif (letter[i] == 'Q'):
        print ('Qu' + suffix)   #setting the program to output the desired output for suffix Q
    else:			#letting every other outcome come out the same
        print(letter + suffix)


#Output: 
Jack
Kack
Lack
Mack
Nack
Ouack
Pack
Quack
